// Instructions: Fix the regex so that it checks for the names of Franklin Roosevelt or Eleanor Roosevelt in a case sensitive manner and it should make concessions for middle names.
// Then fix the code so that the regex that you have created is checked against myString and either true or false is returned depending on whether the regex matches.

// (This is a final code)
// (All FreeCodeCamp tests are passed)

let myString = "Eleanor Roosevelt";
let myRegex = /(Franklin|Eleanor).*Roosevelt/g;
let result = myRegex.test(myString);
