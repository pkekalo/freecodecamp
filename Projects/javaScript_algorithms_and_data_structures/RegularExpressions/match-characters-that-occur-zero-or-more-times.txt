// Instructions: For this challenge, chewieQuote has been initialized as the string Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrgh! behind the scenes. Create a regex chewieRegex that uses the * character to match an uppercase A character immediately followed by zero or more lowercase a characters in chewieQuote. Your regex does not need flags or character classes, and it should not match any of the other quotes.
// (This is a final code)
// (All FreeCodeCamp tests are passed)

let chewieRegex = /Aa*/;

let result = chewieQuote.match(chewieRegex);
