// Instructions: Fix the regex /<.*>/ to return the HTML tag <h1> and not the text "<h1>Winter is coming</h1>". Remember the wildcard . in a regular expression matches any character.
// (This is a final code)
// (All FreeCodeCamp tests are passed)

let text = "<h1>Winter is coming</h1>";
let myRegex = /<.*?>/;
let result = text.match(myRegex);
