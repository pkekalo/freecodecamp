// Instructions: We've defined a function countOnline which accepts one argument (a users object). Use a for...in statement within this function to loop through the users object passed into the function and return the number of users whose online property is set to true. An example of a users object which could be passed to countOnline is shown below. Each user will have an online property with either a true or false value.

// (This is a final code)
// (All FreeCodeCamp tests are passed)

function countOnline(usersObj) {
  let numberOfUsers = 0;
  for (let user in usersObj) {
    if (usersObj[user].online == true) {
        numberOfUsers++;
    }
  }
  return numberOfUsers;
}
