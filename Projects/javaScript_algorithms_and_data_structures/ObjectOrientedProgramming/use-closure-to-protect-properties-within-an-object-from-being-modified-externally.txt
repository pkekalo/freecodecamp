// Instructions: Change how weight is declared in the Bird function so it is a private variable. Then, create a method getWeight that returns the value of weight 15.

// (This is a final code)
// (All FreeCodeCamp tests are passed)

function Bird() {
  let weight = 15;

  this.getWeight = function() {
    return weight;
  }
}
