// Instructions: Fix the string so it either uses different quotes for the href value, or escape the existing ones. Keep the double quote marks around the entire string.

// (This is a final code)
// (All FreeCodeCamp tests are passed)

let innerHtml = "<p>Click here to <a href='#Home'>return home</a></p>";
console.log(innerHtml);
