// Instructions: First, use console.log to log the output variable. Then, use console.clear to clear the browser console.

// (This is a final code)
// (All FreeCodeCamp tests are passed)

// Open your browser console.
let output = "Get this to log once in the freeCodeCamp console and twice in the browser console";
// Use console.log() to print the output variable.
console.log(output);
// Run the tests to see the difference between the two consoles.
console.clear();
// Now, add console.clear() before your console.log() to clear the browser console, and pass the tests.
