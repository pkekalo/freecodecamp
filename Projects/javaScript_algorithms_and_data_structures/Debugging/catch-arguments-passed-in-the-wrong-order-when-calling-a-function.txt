// Instructions: The function raiseToPower raises a base to an exponent. Unfortunately, it's not called properly - fix the code so the value of power is the expected 8.

// (This is a final code)
// (All FreeCodeCamp tests are passed)

function raiseToPower(b, e) {
  return Math.pow(b, e);
}

let base = 2;
let exp = 3;
let power = raiseToPower(base, exp);
console.log(power);
