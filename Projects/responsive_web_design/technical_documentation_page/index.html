				<p>The addition of two whole numbers is the total amount of those values combined.</p>
				<p>Addition is written using the plus sign "<span>+</span>" between the terms; that is, in infix notation. The result is expressed with an equals "=" sign.</p>

					<code>
						Example: 6 + 2 = 8

					<li>Peter has 3 apples and Maria gave 1 apple to Peter, how many apples Peter now have? (The Answer is 4).</li>

				<p>Subtraction is an arithmetic operation that represents the operation of removing objects from a collection. The result of a subtraction is called a difference.</p>
				<p>Subtraction is written using the minus sign "<span>−</span>" between the terms; that is, in infix notation. The result is expressed with an equals "=" sign.</p>
				<div id="code">
					<code>
						Example: 6 - 2 = 4
					</code>

				<h2>Here are subtraction problems to understand subtraction operation.</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Peter has 3 apples and Maria took 1 apple from Peter, how many apples Peter now have? (The Answer is 2).</li>
					<li>On the road there are 4 red cars 3 yellow cars and 2 blue cars went from the road, how many cars are on the road? (The Answer is 7).</li>

			<section class="main-section" id="MULTIPLICATION">
				<header><span>MULTIPLICATION</span></header>
				<p>The multiplication of whole numbers may be thought as a repeated addition; that is, the multiplication of two numbers is equivalent to adding as many copies of one of them, the multiplicand, as the value of the other one, the multiplier.</p>

				<p>In arithmetic, multiplication is often written using the sign "<span>×</span>" between the terms; that is, in infix notation. The result is expressed with an equals "=" sign.</p>
				<div id="code">
					<code>
						Example: 6 * 2 = 12
					</code>
				</div>
				<h2>Here are multiplication problems to understand multiplication operation.</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Three Friends all have 6 apples, how many apples they have in total? (The Answer is 18).</li>
					<li>On the road there are 4 red cars and twice more of blue cars, how many of blue cars there are on the road? (The Answer is 8).</li>
				</ul>

			<section class="main-section" id="DIVISION">
				<header><span>DIVISION</span></header>
				<p>At an elementary level the division of two natural numbers is the process of calculating the number of times one number is contained within another one.</p>

				<p>Division is often shown in algebra and science by placing the dividend over the divisor with a horizontal line, also called a fraction bar, between them. For example, a divided by b is written (a<span>/</span>b). The result is expressed with an equals "=" sign.</p> 
				<div id="code">
					<code>
						Example: 6 / 2 = 3
					</code>
				</div>
				<h2>Here are division problems to understand division operation.</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Three Friends have 6 apples and they all want same amount of apples, how many apples will each have? (The Answer is 2).</li>
					<li>On the road there are 4 red cars 3 yellow cars and 2 blue cars, there are same amount of cars in three lanes how many cars are in each lane? (The Answer is 3).</li>
				</ul>

			<section class="main-section" id="EXPONENTIATION">
				<header><span>EXPONENTIATION</span></header>
				<p>Exponentiation is a mathematical operation, written as bn, involving two numbers, the base b and the exponent n.</p>

				<p>The exponent is usually shown as a superscript to the right of the base. In that case, bn is called "b raised to the n-th power", "b raised to the power of n", or "the n-th power of b" (<span>b^n</span>).</p>
				<h2>Here are three of the exponentiation problems to understand exponentiation operation</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Peter has 3 apples and each apple has amount of seeds equal to amout of apples, how many seeds are in total? (The Answer is 9).</li>
					<li>On the road there were 4 red cars and each red car had blue cars on his back. Each red car has the same amount of red cars that are color blue. How many blue cars that are one the road? (The answer is 16).</li>
				</ul>
