		Space Cheese, a freeze dried cheese, is made from real cheese without adding anything else. It has a crunchy texture and the flavor opens up after re-hydration in your mouth. Bite size pieces are convenient to eat: as an individual snack, with freeze dried apples or tomatoes, or with salad. They also can be a complimentary snack to wine and beer. Recommended for a low carb diet. Made in the USA (Vermont) Family owned and operated small business.

		We make Space freeze dried ice cream at our facility in White River Junction, Vermont. First, real ice cream is made from scratch using local ingredients whenever we can. Then the ice cream is freeze dried and shaped into bite size pieces using unique technology. Freeze dried ice cream is light, does not have to be refrigerated, is not perishable, melts in your mouth, and tastes like real ice cream. Thatâ€™s why it could be sent to space for astronauts. Try it and love it! ðŸ™‚ Space Ice Cream is wheat and egg free and it is hand made from scratch. Expect taste and texture to be different from regular mass produced Astronaut Ice Cream. 100% Satisfaction guarantee. Love it or your money back!
